# Zeppelin's Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

If you're interested in contributing to Zeppelin, you will first need to sign a Contributor License Agreement.
This agreement gives the developer the ability to license and release your contribution in the project, and sets several expectations for both parties. You can see the full CLA in [CLA.md](./CLA.md).

## Signing the CLA

Zeppelin's CLA is signed on a per-GitHub-account basis, requiring you to reveal no personal information.
Due to this, **the CLA is only considered signed for [verified commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification) from the GitHub account that signed the agreement** and any past contributions from the account prior to signing.
In practice, this means any and all of your contributions will need to use [signed commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification).

To sign the CLA, create a PR to this repository that adds a file in the `signatures` folder with your username. For example, `signatures/Dragory.md`. [**This commit must be marked as verified by GitHub.**](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification). You can see an example at [#1](https://github.com/ZeppelinBot/CLA/pull/1).

Within this file, include the following contents:

```
I sign the Contributor License Agreement as it is currently in [CLA.md](../CLA.md).
```

Once the PR is merged, the CLA will be considered signed **for verified commits from the GitHub account that signed the agreement** and your past contributions under this GitHub account.
